# Wall App

A simple web application that allows users to post messages on a public wall.

## Existing Deployment

This app has been deployed on Heroku. The Frontend deployment is designed for best user experience, but the backend is also provided below for example.

Frontend: https://wall-app-frontend.herokuapp.com/

Backend: https://wall-app-backend.herokuapp.com/

Note: Because these apps are deployed to a free Heroku account, the apps will sleep when inactive. As a result, the Frontend may take a few moments to render the posts from the Backend.

## Usage

This repository is best suited for development. All 'localhost' references would need to be updated appropriately before deployment. Additionally, debug mode in `settings.py` should be turned off.
